# News: now and then

## Compare today to 150 years ago
The modern world moves at a furious pace. It seems that day by day there are so many breaking news items, natural disasters, coup d'etats, revolutions, terrorist attacks, elections, crises...

... that it can feel totally overwhelming to keep up. When these seismic shifts happen in our hyper-connected world, the people on the front line are not journalists from mainstream media organisations. They are people like you and me. Consumers of the news have also become the creators, and they are able to react to things at a rate of pace that is impossible for most formal outlets.
